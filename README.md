jQuery.imgBox
=============

Yet another lightbox alternative.

Yeah, we have lots of those, I know. but what I was after was a simple and beautiful lightbox plugin that will have this neat zoom effect and slideshow capabilities (previous/next controls), using jQuery and Sass would be cool and yeah, it better be free and open source.

The original imgBox v1 was a good start - it had the zoom effect, was using jQuery and licensed as open-source.
What I did was first update it to the most recent jQuery, add the slideshow feature, then style it using the power of Sass, a few tweeks here and there, and there it is:
